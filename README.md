Advanced Database Organization

Database Organization (C)
This system contained 3 components, a storage manager, a buffer manager and a record manager.
Assignment 1,a storage manager was implemented. It reads blocks from a file on disk into memory and writes blocks from memory to a file on disk.
Assignment 2, a buffer manager was implemented. It manages a fixed number of pages in memory that represent pages from a file. 
Assignment 3, a record manager was implemented. It handles tables with a fixed schema, so that it supports records insertion, deletion, updating and scanning.
